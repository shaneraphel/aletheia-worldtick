# `graph_longrange`

`graph_longrange` provides various long-range operatoins in pytorch, for use in charge-aware MLIPs. The repo works mostly with Gaussian type orbitals, and provides the following fundamental operations. All the code is pytorch and for systems up to a few thousand atoms on a single GPU, the code is reasonably fast compared to many modern MLIPs.

- [x] **Coulomb Energy** from a set of atoms with **atomic multipole moments**
- [x] **Atom Centered Electrostatic Features**, similar to the LODE descriptor 
- [x] Damped Coulomb Interactions via **Gaussian Type Orbitals**, instead of point charges
- [x] Consistent **Realspace and Periodic** Implementations
- [x] Correction terms to energy and features for handling **slab geometries**, as well as molecules in boxes
- [x] Efficient **batching** for pytorch training
- [x] Considerable **precopmutation** for electrostatic features to speed up self-consistent-field loops
- [x] Interpolation functions for probing the potential and density around atomistic systems
- [x] Confined Jellium slabs of charge, useful when simulating electrochemical interfaces

This repo currently supports several long-range MLIP architectures including the MACE-POLAR-1 foundation model.
